AssetGuard AI: Creating Smart Contracts Based on Predicted Uptrend/Downtrend and News Sentiment

Our project is a smart asset allocator that tracks the news and financial trends of ALGORAND, tracks the sentiment of the news and predicted uptrend/downtrend of ALGORAND over the next 7 days, then will allow you to 
create smart contracts for buying/selling ALGOTRAND when a minimum uptrend/downtrend percentage is made along with a minimum/maximum price to buy/sell.

Technical Description:  Langgraph (for organizing the chatbot main interaction), Anthropic Claude (for summarizing the news), Algosdk (for interfacing with and deploying the smart contracts), PyTeal (for creating the smart contracts), Darts (for time series forecasting of ALGORAND's price)
